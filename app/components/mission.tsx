            At Game Horizon, our mission is to build a platform that brings the
            joy of gaming into focus, helping players reflect on the games they
            have played, stay organized with their current adventures, and look
            ahead to future gaming experiences. We aim to create a space where
            every gamer, regardless of their preferences or platform, can feel
            at home.

            Gaming is more than just a hobby—it’s a part of who we are. Every
            game, from the simplest puzzle to the most complex RPG, contributes
            to a unique gaming story. At Game Horizon, we aim to provide a space
            where gamers can celebrate their journey. Whether it’s through
            nostalgia for games you've played or excitement for what’s to come,
            we want your gaming experiences to take center stage.

            We know that managing your gaming library can be overwhelming. With
            new releases constantly hitting the market and backlogs piling up,
            it’s easy to lose track. That’s why Game Horizon is built to help
            you organize everything in one place. From tracking the games you're
            currently playing to curating a wishlist of titles you can't wait to
            explore, our goal is to make game tracking effortless and enjoyable.

            Gaming isn’t just about the past and present—it’s about the future
            too. By allowing you to create a wishlist of games you want to play
            next, we hope to inspire you to discover new genres, revisit classic
            titles, or explore upcoming releases that align with your
            preferences. Game Horizon is designed to fuel your excitement for
            what’s on the horizon.

            While Game Horizon is built for individual use, we envision it as a
            platform where players can also share recommendations, discuss
            favorite games, and connect with fellow gamers. In the future, we
            plan to introduce features that will enable a community-driven space
            where gamers can interact, share their gaming logs, and inspire each
            other.
